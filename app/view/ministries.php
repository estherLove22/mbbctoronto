    <br/>a Church - Metropolitan Bible
    <br/>Baptist Church Toronto.
    <br/> I'm blessed and privileged to

    <br/> the years the giving of the Church
    <br/>increases and always been above the
    <br/> year's budget. I commend the faithful
    <br/>members of this Church who have learned and
    <br/> applied the Bible principles on giving...
    <br/>Malachi 3:10". --- Sis. Ofel Espedido</p>
