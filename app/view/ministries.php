				<h1>COMPOSITION</h1>
				<h4>MINISTRIES</h4>
				
				<p>
I truly praise the Lord for His bountiful blessings
for MBBC, and that includes enabling us to start
a new ministry of composing songs.
It all started with a desire in doing more
for the glory of the Lord. During
the pandemic in the year 2020, we were
inspired and challenged to still continue serving and giving our best for God.
Many of our members and even our beloved
Pastor, by God's grace, were able to
write or create God-honouring sacred songs. Now, we have made more than a hundred
compositions in the past couple years.
It has been a great and wonderful
blessing and encouragement, not only
to MBBC Toronto, but to many Christians
around the world. All the glory and
praise belongs to our loving God alone. - Chelzy Joy Respicio

				<h1>PUBLICATION</h1>
				<h4>MINISTRIES</h4>
				<p>Looking back, I remember a time when the publications
  				<br/>  ministry only composed of a few people. Looking
 				<br/>   now, it's amazing to see how God has added
				<br/>   to this ministry, not only in terms  of what we 
				<br/> are able to do but also in the people He uses.
				<br/>   I praise and thank God for giving every one of
   				<br/>  us the privilege to 
be part of this wonderful ministry. Through this ministry,
 we are able to witness God's faithfulness time and time
 again through answered prayers, finance and attendance 
reports. It is also through this ministry that we are able
 to help other ministries. I thank God for giving us 
wisdom, strength, and grace to finish our projects, especially
 during late nights. I also thank Him for a church family that
 is always willing to help whenever it is needed. Personally,
 this ministry has a special place in my heart because I've 
been part of this ministry since I was fourteen. I look forward
 to God using not only me, but all the wonderful people in 
this ministry, for many more years to come. I cannot wait to 
see what God has in store for us!

	<p>I praise and Thank God for giving me
    <br/>a Church - Metropolitan Bible
    <br/>Baptist Church Toronto.
    <br/> I'm blessed and privileged to
    <br/> witness the growth of our
    <br/>Church - from its humble beginning
    <br/> to where it is now. MBBC is a
    <br/>living testament of God's grace - His
    <br/>provision is all sufficient. Through
    <br/> the years the giving of the Church
    <br/>increases and always been above the
    <br/> year's budget. I commend the faithful
    <br/>members of this Church who have learned and
    <br/> applied the Bible principles on giving...
